Even though the current system contains multiple security threats, these could be easily fixed and avoided by applying a basic security policy.
Most importantly, the company should introduce regular checks to ensure that the software running on their server is up to date.
Second, they should introduce a regular task to renew their SSL certificate to make sure that it does not expire.
If possible, the company should perform regular vulnerability checks as well to find any new threats that might be introduced when making new configurations on the server.

By applying this simple policy, the company should retain decent protection against common vulnerabilities and attacks.
